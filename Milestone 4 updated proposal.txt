We have mostly followed with our proposal. We added music and sound effect, we fixed all bugs identified in prior milestones and completed a comprehensive tutorial page. We also have adjust based on user feedback, many user suggested that a map will be really helpful in our game so we have added a minimap on the top left corner of our game play screen to giver user a better experience. We have finished all game levels. 

We did not do lighting system and shadowing based on the proposal in the milestone but we have implement a new particle system to simulate wind and a new bee item to have some bees to perform swarm behaviour. We also have an external integration with “nlohmann/json JSON for Modern C++” to save user positions when they exist the game unexpectedly or in a middle of a level. We also used shader to create a light circle that goes with the player to make the UI more adventurous. 

In the future after this course, we will definitely continue to work on the gaming project. Sometime that could be added is such as lighting system, more advance background component and interaction, more advance AI.
